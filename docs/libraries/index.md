# Libraries

Libraries are either user defined scripts or interfaces provided by the MacroScriptingMod to interact with the game.

A library can be imported using

```lua
require("library_name")
```

## Provided libraries

Provided libraries do not need to be imported manually.

## User defined libraries

If you want to import a user defined library, simply use the name of the script without the `.lua` extension.  
More information around this topic can be found [here](https://www.lua.org/pil/8.1.html).
